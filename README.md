Welcome to My GitHub. Thanks for stopping by! :)

## About me 
I'm a third year software engineering student and part-time photographer with a passion for building cool stuff 😎 to solve real-world problems.

### ✨ Fun Facts
- 🍵 I code better with Matcha. If you ever need cafe recommendations in the Montreal area, I have some that will change your life 🤫
- 🏋🏻‍♀️ If I'm not cooking up something here, I'm lifting heavy at the gym, or perfecting my craft 📸.
- 🌱 I'm always learning — currently diving into **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision** and **React Native**.
